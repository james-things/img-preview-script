# img-preview-script

A quick and hacky python script to preview generated images in a mini gui window!~

This window will refresh every few seconds, and displays the most recently created image file
in the folder where it is run. I threw it together quickly so there are likely bugs!

(intended for use with stable diffusion deforum local version)

ps. I am very tired and will fix up a few small problems tomorrow

## instructions

Ensure that you have the necessary dependencies per the imports, place the script in your output folder, and run it - voila!
